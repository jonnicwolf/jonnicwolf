### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jon, please call me Fezz. I specialize in web development and I'm currently working on a a Hex Chess game built in React. 
I program in JavaScript, Python, Swift and GoLang!

In addition to my professional work, I'm a huge motorsports, boxing and football fan. When I'm not coding, I can be found mountain biking, swimming, or powerlifting.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift
