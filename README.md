### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fezz! Check out my live works [here](https://jonnicwolf.dev). 
I'm currently working on [Esperi](https://esperi.netlify.app). 
I program in JavaScript, Python, Swift and GoLang!

In addition to my professional work, I'm a huge motorsports, boxing and football fan. When I'm not coding, I can be found mountain biking, swimming, or powerlifting.
