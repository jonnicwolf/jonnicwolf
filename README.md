### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fezz! Check out my live works [here](https://fezz.vercel.app). 
I'm currently working on [Esperi](https://esperi.vercel.app). 
I program in TypeScript, Python, and Swift!

In addition to my professional work, I'm a huge motorsports, boxing and football fan. When I'm not coding, I can be found biking, reading or trying restaurants.
