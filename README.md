### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fezz, a Software Apprentice Engineer at SeatGeek. I learned software engineering principles and fundaments at Pursuit in Long Island City, NYC. I specialize in web development and I'm currently working on a turn based table top adventure game website. I have experience with several programming languages including JavaScript & TypeScript, Python, GoLang, and Terraform.

In addition to my professional work, I'm a huge motorsports, boxing and football fan. When I'm not coding, I can be found mountain biking, swimming, or powerlifting.
